			<p>Axolotls are rare endangered animals that come in a variety of colors and have a talent for being able to regenerate almost all of their body parts! Most axolotls you will find today are kept as pets in people's homes, or part of scientific research studies. These adorable creatures are special because they look like babies forever and their regenerative abilities are furthering a path for scientific studies on stem cells.</p>
