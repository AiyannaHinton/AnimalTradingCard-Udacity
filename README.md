#Animal Trading Card

A fun trading card meant for my front end web development class in Udacity Front End Web Development course.

In this project I learned to use HTML and CSS to create a unique trading card featuring one of my favorite animals.

I ran into my issues while learning how to apply the back shadow in this piece, but overall for my first attempt at a project feel that it turned out very well.
